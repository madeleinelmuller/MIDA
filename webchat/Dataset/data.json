      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects brain development, impacting an individual's ability to focus, control impulses, and regulate activity levels. While historically associated with childhood, ADHD is increasingly recognized in adults, with over 8 million adults in the U.S. estimated to be affected. The condition can manifest differently across age groups, from hyperactivity in children to challenges with focus and procrastination in adults. The exact causes are not fully understood, but genetic factors are believed to play a role, and research explores connections with brain chemicals like dopamine, as well as childhood trauma.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosing ADHD in adults does not rely on a single test. Healthcare professionals assess symptoms and medical history. Tools such as executive function tests, which evaluate various cognitive skills, may be used. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has also been approved by the FDA for ADHD diagnosis. For children, the Conners Scale is one of several rating scales used.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for ADHD typically involves a multifaceted approach. Medication is a common component for managing symptoms, but effective treatment often includes other strategies. Psychotherapy, particularly behavior therapy for children and family therapy, can be beneficial. ADHD coaching offers professional support for developing daily management strategies. Lifestyle adjustments, such as managing sleep problems and avoiding habits that worsen symptoms, are also important.

      "disease_name": "Allergies",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a substance that is typically harmless, identifying it as a dangerous invader. This overreaction leads to an allergic response. Allergies can affect individuals of any age and are triggered by various substances, including pollen (seasonal), dust mites, animal dander, mold, insect stings, certain medications, and specific foods. The severity of allergic reactions can range from minor irritation to a life-threatening emergency known as anaphylaxis.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "An allergist can identify specific allergy triggers using diagnostic methods such as allergy skin tests (scratch tests) or blood tests, which measure allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Consultation with a doctor is advisable if allergies are suspected to confirm the diagnosis.",
      "how_to_care": "The primary management strategy for allergies involves strictly avoiding known triggers. Medications commonly used to alleviate symptoms include oral antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine), corticosteroid nasal sprays (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide, triamcinolone), cromolyn sodium nasal spray, and oral decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine). Nasal rinsing with saline solution can also help. For some individuals, allergy shots (immunotherapy) can reduce the immune system's reaction over time. In cases of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), immediate administration of an epinephrine auto-injector is critical, followed by an emergency room visit. Maintaining a diary of symptoms and triggers can aid in identifying patterns, and wearing a medical alert bracelet is recommended for individuals with severe allergies."

      "disease_name": "Angina",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Angina, also known as ischemic chest pain or angina pectoris, is a symptom of heart disease characterized by chest pain that occurs when a part of the heart muscle does not receive adequate blood supply. This insufficient blood flow is typically due to blockages or narrowing in the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Angina pain can radiate to areas such as the shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. While angina usually resolves quickly, it is a serious indicator of a potentially life-threatening heart problem, necessitating medical evaluation to determine its cause and prevent a heart attack. Unlike a heart attack, angina does not cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of angina involves a physical examination, a detailed review of symptoms, risk factors, and family history. Additional tests may include an EKG (Electrocardiogram) to measure the heart's electrical activity, a stress test to evaluate heart function during exertion, and blood tests to check for specific proteins (troponins) indicative of heart muscle damage. Imaging tests such as chest X-rays, echocardiograms, CT scans, and MRI scans are used to visualize the heart. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography can assess blood flow and identify blockages in heart arteries. A doctor may refer patients to an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist specializing in heart rhythm disorders.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for angina depends on the extent of heart damage. For mild cases, medication and lifestyle changes can improve blood flow and control symptoms. Medications include nitrates or calcium channel blockers (to widen blood vessels), beta-blockers (to slow heart rate), blood thinners/antiplatelet medications (to prevent clots), and statins (to lower cholesterol). If medications are insufficient, cardiac procedures such as angioplasty/stenting (to open narrowed arteries) or coronary artery bypass grafting (bypass surgery) may be performed. Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) is a non-invasive option to boost blood flow to the heart. Lifestyle changes are crucial and include quitting smoking, adopting a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, regular exercise, and consistent doctor visits. It is important to stop activity if pain occurs and avoid triggers. If new or unusual chest pain is experienced, immediate emergency medical attention is necessary."

      "disease_name": "Appendicitis",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ extending from the large intestine. It is considered a medical emergency that almost always requires surgical removal of the appendix as soon as possible. The condition occurs when the appendix becomes blocked, often by hardened stool, a foreign body, or a tumor, or when it swells in response to an infection. It is most common in individuals between 10 and 30 years old and affects individuals assigned male at birth more frequently.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosing appendicitis can be challenging due to its symptoms often mimicking other conditions such as gallbladder problems, urinary tract infections, Crohn's disease, kidney stones, or ovarian issues. Diagnostic procedures include an abdominal examination, urine tests (to rule out UTIs), rectal exams, and blood tests to detect signs of infection. Imaging tests such as CT scans (considered most accurate) and ultrasounds are also used. For individuals who are pregnant, a pregnancy test and ultrasound may be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, and a pelvic exam may be conducted to rule out pelvic inflammatory disease or ovarian cysts.",
      "how_to_care": "Appendicitis is almost always treated as an emergency, with surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy) being the standard approach to prevent rupture. Antibiotics are typically administered before surgery. Post-surgery care involves pain relievers, intravenous fluids, and a gradual return to solid foods. Activity should be limited for a few days to weeks, depending on the surgical method (laparoscopic vs. open surgery). Patients should contact their doctor immediately if they experience uncontrolled vomiting, increased abdominal pain, dizziness, blood in vomit or urine, fever, or pus at the surgical site. It is crucial not to eat, drink, or use pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads if appendicitis is suspected, as these can worsen the condition."

      "disease_name": "Arachnoiditis",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Arachnoiditis is a chronic pain disorder characterized by severe stinging and burning pain, along with various neurological problems. It develops when the arachnoid mater, one of the three protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, becomes inflamed. This inflammation can be triggered by irritants such as complications from spinal surgery or procedures like epidural injections and spinal taps, infections (e.g., bacterial meningitis of the spine), or chronic compression of spinal nerves due to conditions like degenerative disc disease or advanced spinal stenosis. As the condition progresses, symptoms can become more severe or permanent, leading to significant disability.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of arachnoiditis can be challenging. Imaging tests such as CAT scans (computerized axial tomography) or MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are helpful in identifying the condition. An electromyogram (EMG) may also be used to assess the extent of nerve root damage by checking nerve function with electrical impulses.",
      "how_to_care": "Currently, there is no cure for arachnoiditis. Treatment primarily focuses on pain relief and improving symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Healthcare professionals often recommend a comprehensive program that includes pain management, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychotherapy. Surgery for arachnoiditis is considered controversial due to potentially poor outcomes and only short-term relief. Further clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of treatments such as steroid injections and electrical stimulation."

      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Arthritis is a broad term encompassing various conditions characterized by inflammation and pain in the joints. These conditions can be broadly categorized as autoimmune diseases, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis), or degenerative conditions resulting from wear and tear on the joints (e.g., Osteoarthritis). The specific type of arthritis determines its underlying cause and progression.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination of the affected joints, blood tests to identify specific markers or signs of inflammation, analysis of joint fluid samples, and imaging tests such as X-rays. These diagnostic tools help differentiate between the various forms of arthritis.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for arthritis aims to reduce inflammation, alleviate pain and swelling, strengthen joints, improve joint movement, and prevent further joint damage. Medical interventions include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to slow disease progression, biologics that target specific immune responses, and corticosteroids for severe inflammation. Beyond medication, physical and occupational therapy, regular exercise, and the application of hot or cold treatments are crucial components of care. The specific treatment approach is highly individualized based on the type and severity of arthritis."

It is an increasingly common problem affecting individuals across all age groups, including adults, teenagers, and children. Asthma symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. A frequent trigger for asthma attacks is exposure to allergens, highlighting a common comorbidity with allergies.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of asthma typically begins with a doctor's consultation if an individual experiences symptoms such as breathlessness or frequent nighttime coughing. Lung function tests, also known as pulmonary function tests, are commonly performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess lung capacity and airflow.",
      "how_to_care": "Early and aggressive treatment is crucial for managing asthma symptoms and preventing severe attacks. Treatment options include various medications, such as inhalers (e.g., Trelegy Ellipta, Fasenra) and other asthma drugs designed to quickly alleviate coughing and wheezing. Beyond medication, lifestyle management plays a significant role. This includes adopting specific dietary tips, engaging in appropriate exercises, and implementing strategies to manage stress, anxiety, and depression, which can influence asthma symptoms. Developing a personalized asthma action plan is also vital for effective self-management and emergency preparedness."

      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Avascular necrosis (AVN), also known as osteonecrosis, is a condition characterized by the death of bone tissue due to an interruption of its blood supply. If left untreated, AVN can lead to the collapse of the affected bone. The hip is the most commonly affected site, but AVN can also occur in the shoulder, knees, and ankles. In its early stages, AVN may not present any symptoms, but as it progresses, it typically becomes very painful. The time from symptom onset to bone collapse can range from several months to over a year. AVN affects approximately 20,000 people annually, primarily individuals between 20 and 50 years old. Most cases result from an underlying health problem or injury, rather than occurring in otherwise healthy individuals.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of avascular necrosis typically begins with a physical examination to check for tender spots and assess range of motion. Imaging tests are crucial for identifying the cause of pain and include bone scans, MRI, CT scans (which can show early bone changes), and X-rays (which may appear normal in early stages but show changes later).",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment goals for AVN are to alleviate pain, improve joint function, and halt further bone damage. Treatment choice depends on age, disease stage, location and extent of damage, and the underlying cause. Early diagnosis allows for treatments such as pain medications and limiting use of the affected area (e.g., crutches). Medications may include blood thinners (if caused by clots), NSAIDs for pain, and cholesterol drugs. Surgical options, often necessary as the disease progresses, include bone grafts, osteotomy, total joint replacement, core decompression, vascularized bone graft, and electrical stimulation to promote new bone growth. Home care involves rest (avoiding weight on joint) and physical therapy exercises to maintain joint mobility. Prevention strategies include reducing alcohol intake, managing cholesterol levels, cautious use of steroid drugs, and avoiding smoking."

      "disease_name": "Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection that primarily affects birds but can occasionally spread to mammals, including humans. While bird flu does not easily spread among people, outbreaks have occurred, such as the 2024 U.S. outbreak affecting dairy cows and industry workers. The most common type is the H5N1 strain. Human-to-human transmission is very rare, typically occurring only with very close contact. The virus primarily affects the respiratory tract, but rare cases can involve the brain and digestive tract, which can be life-threatening.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis cannot be based solely on symptoms, as they resemble common flu. Doctors typically take a throat or nose swab for testing in a specialized lab. Accuracy is higher if the test is performed within the first few days of illness. Patients should inform their doctor about any suspected exposure to infected animals.",
      "how_to_care": "Antiviral drugs, such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Peramivir (Rapivab), and Zanamivir (Relenza), can be prescribed if caught early, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. Prevention measures include maintaining distance from wild birds (especially sick or dead ones), avoiding contact with animals known to have H5N1 and contaminated surfaces, and not consuming raw milk or undercooked poultry/eggs. An FDA-approved vaccine for human H5N1 exists but is not commercially available; the U.S. government is developing vaccines for potential future need. The seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against bird flu but may help prevent severe infection."

      "disease_name": "Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal infection caused by an imbalance in the normal bacterial flora of the vagina. It is a very common condition, affecting approximately 35% of individuals with a vagina at some point, with higher rates among Black individuals. While generally not causing other severe health problems, BV can lead to complications, particularly during pregnancy or when attempting to conceive. BV is distinct from yeast infections, being bacterial in origin rather than fungal, and is not classified as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), though sexual activity can increase its risk.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis typically involves a doctor or nurse examining the vulva and vagina. A sample of vaginal discharge is collected via a swab for lab examination, which may include a wet mount/vaginal smear, a whiff test (detecting a fishy smell when mixed with a chemical), and a vaginal pH test (high acidity indicates BV). A PCR test to detect bacterial DNA is less common due to higher cost. Professional medical diagnosis is recommended over home test kits due to accuracy concerns.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for BV usually involves prescription antibiotics, even if symptoms are absent, as untreated BV can persist or worsen. Antibiotic medications can be taken orally (tablets, granules) or inserted vaginally (ovule suppository, cream, gel), including clindamycin, metronidazole, secnidazole, and tinidazole. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics. Sexual contact should be avoided until medication is completed and symptoms resolve. Home remedies like probiotics (yogurt, kefir), garlic supplements, Vitamin C, and boric acid suppositories may offer some relief, but medical consultation is advised. Prevention strategies include using condoms, avoiding douching, keeping sex toys clean, reducing sex partners, and using mild, unscented soaps for vaginal hygiene."

      "disease_name": "Bladder Infections (UTI)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that can occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Women and individuals with female anatomy have a higher likelihood of developing UTIs, with approximately 50% experiencing at least one in their lifetime, often due to their shorter urethras which facilitate bacterial entry from the large intestine (e.g., E. coli). While rare in children and young men, UTIs become more common in men over 50, often linked to enlarged prostate glands. If left untreated, UTIs can spread to the kidneys, leading to more severe symptoms.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of a UTI typically involves a urine dipstick test for quick results, a urinalysis for microscopic examination of the urine, or a urine culture to identify the specific bacteria and determine antibiotic effectiveness, especially for recurrent infections. For frequent UTIs or suspected urinary tract problems, doctors may use imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or IVP (intravenous pyelogram), as well as a cystoscopic exam or urodynamics. A blood test (complete blood count) may be ordered if an upper-tract UTI is suspected.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for UTIs primarily involves prescription antibiotics, which usually work within 3 days to 6 weeks, and it is crucial to complete the entire prescribed course. Over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) and heating pads can help manage symptoms, but do not treat the infection. Drinking plenty of water is recommended to help flush bacteria. For recurrent UTIs, low-dose antibiotics over a longer period, a single dose after sex, or non-antibiotic prophylaxis treatments (e.g., cranberry products, D-mannose, methenamine with vitamin C, vaginal estrogen cream for menopausal women) may be considered. Prevention strategies include frequent hand washing, completely emptying the bladder, wiping front to back, choosing showers over baths, avoiding feminine hygiene sprays/douches, urinating after sex, and wearing cotton underwear."

      "disease_name": "Bronchitis (Acute)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Acute bronchitis is an infection and inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the airways that carry air to the lungs. This condition commonly develops after a cold or the flu and is most frequently caused by a viral infection. Consequently, antibiotics are generally ineffective against acute bronchitis. It is typically a self-limiting condition, meaning it usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of acute bronchitis is primarily based on the patient's symptoms and a physical examination. A doctor should be consulted if the cough produces yellow or green mucus, or blood, if it persists for more than 3 weeks, if it significantly disrupts sleep, or if it is accompanied by a fever exceeding 100.4 F, wheezing, or shortness of breath. These indicators may suggest a more serious underlying condition or a bacterial co-infection.",
      "how_to_care": "Care for acute bronchitis focuses on symptom relief and supporting the body's natural healing process. This includes getting ample rest and drinking plenty of fluids (8-12 glasses daily) to help thin mucus, though individuals with heart or kidney failure should consult their doctor regarding fluid intake. Using a humidifier or inhaling steam from a hot shower or a bowl of hot water can help loosen mucus. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen can be used to manage fever and mild pain. Cough suppressants may be considered, but generally not while the lungs are actively clearing mucus, and they should be avoided for children younger than 4. Saltwater gargling can soothe an irritated throat. If influenza is the underlying cause, antiviral medication may be prescribed early in the illness. It is crucial to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, dust, and chemical fumes; wearing a mask may be beneficial if cold air triggers coughing."

They typically present as white or yellowish open wounds with a red border. There are three types: minor (most common, oval, heal in ~1 week), major (less common, larger, painful, may scar), and herpetiform (rare, clusters of tiny ulcers). Canker sores are not contagious and are distinct from cold sores (which are viral and contagious). The exact cause is often unknown, but contributing factors include stress, tissue injury, acidic foods, NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori, weakened immune system, nutritional deficiencies, and gut diseases like celiac or Crohn's. They are more common in women and may have a familial component.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of canker sores is usually based on their visual appearance and reported pain level. A doctor or dentist should be consulted if sores are unusually large, spreading, or persist for 2 weeks or longer; if there is extreme pain despite home remedies; if difficulty drinking fluids occurs; if a high fever accompanies the sores; or if mouth sores are frequent or persistent, as these could indicate more serious underlying conditions. Blood, swab, or tissue sample tests may be conducted to check for vitamin deficiencies or other health conditions.",
      "how_to_care": "Minor canker sores typically heal on their own within one to two weeks without specific treatment. For larger, longer-lasting, or very painful sores, treatments may include prescription mouthwashes (containing steroids or painkillers), topical medications (creams, gels, pastes, or liquids with steroids or topical analgesics like lidocaine), oral medications (e.g., ulcer drugs, gout drugs, steroid pills), or nutritional supplements if a deficiency is identified. Cautery (using dental lasers or chemical substances) may also be performed. Home remedies include rinsing the mouth with warm salt water or baking soda solution, dabbing milk of magnesia on the sore, or applying aloe vera or honey. Prevention involves avoiding irritating foods (acidic fruits/vegetables, spicy foods), refraining from chewing gum, practicing good oral hygiene (brushing with a soft-bristled brush, flossing), and maintaining a healthy, balanced diet."

      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), also known as median nerve compression, is a condition characterized by numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand. These symptoms arise from pressure on the median nerve as it passes through a narrow passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve controls movement and sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring finger. Symptoms typically develop gradually, often starting at night, and tend to worsen without treatment. The condition is frequently linked to repetitive wrist motions, suggesting a connection to occupational health and ergonomics.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome usually involves a physical examination by a healthcare professional. During the exam, the doctor may assess the patient's symptoms and perform specific tests to evaluate nerve function and identify areas of compression. While not explicitly detailed in the provided information for diagnosis, imaging (such as MRI or ultrasound) may be used in some cases to visualize the median nerve and surrounding structures.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ranges from self-care measures to surgical intervention, depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition. Self-care includes applying ice to the wrist, performing gentle movements, soaking the hand in warm water, resting the hands and wrists, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. Wrist braces are often recommended, particularly during sleep, to keep the wrist in a straight, neutral position. Modifying activities, such as taking regular breaks, adjusting workstation setup, alternating hand use, and reducing excessive force, can help. Medical treatments include corticosteroid injections or oral steroids for temporary relief of pain and swelling. Physical and occupational therapy can provide exercises to strengthen muscles and teach modified motions. Alternative therapies like yoga, ultrasound therapy, and acupuncture may also be explored. If conservative treatments are ineffective after 6 months, surgery (open or endoscopic) may be recommended to relieve pressure on the median nerve."

      "detailed_description": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and other grains. In individuals with celiac disease, gluten ingestion leads to damage in the small intestine, impairing nutrient absorption. The progression of intestinal damage is often slow, and symptoms can vary widely, leading to a significant number of affected individuals being unaware they have the condition. This asymptomatic nature presents a diagnostic challenge, as the condition can remain 'silent' for extended periods.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of celiac disease often involves a tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTg-IgA) test, which is an effective method for detecting antibodies associated with the condition. Given that many individuals may be asymptomatic, specific testing is crucial for identification.",
      "how_to_care": "The primary and most effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong avoidance of gluten. Adhering to a gluten-free diet is essential to prevent further intestinal damage and manage symptoms."

      "detailed_description": "Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a common and typically mild childhood illness caused by a specific virus. It is highly infectious and is most prevalent in children under the age of 10. Most adults are immune to chickenpox because they contracted the illness during childhood. The virus spreads easily through respiratory secretions or direct contact with fluid from the blisters. A notable aspect of this virus is its ability to remain dormant in the body after recovery and reactivate later in life, causing shingles.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of chickenpox is usually clinical, based on the characteristic rash and accompanying symptoms.",
      "how_to_care": "Chickenpox is generally self-limiting, meaning it resolves on its own. Individuals with chickenpox should avoid contact with others until all blisters have crusted over, which typically occurs 5 to 6 days after the rash first appears. For high-risk individuals, such as pregnant women, newborn babies, or those with weakened immune systems, seeking immediate medical advice is crucial if they are exposed or develop symptoms. Medical attention is also warranted if the individual becomes seriously ill, if blisters show signs of infection, or if chest pain or difficulty breathing occurs. Vaccination is considered the most effective method for preventing chickenpox and reducing its spread within the population."

      "disease_name": "Constipation",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Constipation is a common digestive problem characterized by infrequent bowel movements (generally fewer than three stools per week) or difficulty passing stool. It occurs when stool moves too slowly through the large intestine (colon), leading to excessive water absorption and resulting in hard, dry, and difficult-to-pass stools. Constipation can stem from various factors, including lifestyle choices (insufficient fluids, lack of dietary fiber, inadequate exercise, ignoring the urge to defecate), side effects of certain medications (e.g., opioids, drugs for high blood pressure, seizures, depression, allergies), problems with pelvic floor muscles, or physical blockages in the colon or rectum (e.g., tumors). It can also be linked to underlying medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, nerve dysfunction or damage, overactive thyroid, Parkinson's disease, and pregnancy.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of constipation is primarily based on reported symptoms and medical history. A healthcare professional should be consulted if symptoms persist longer than three weeks, significantly interfere with daily activities, if there is rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, unusual changes in stool shape or color, persistent stomach pain, or unexplained weight loss. These additional symptoms may indicate a more serious underlying condition.",
      "how_to_care": "Management of constipation often begins with lifestyle modifications. This includes increasing dietary fiber intake by consuming plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole-grain foods, while limiting low-fiber processed foods, dairy, and meats. Drinking ample fluids and engaging in regular exercise are also crucial. Establishing a regular schedule for bowel movements and not ignoring the urge to defecate can help regulate habits. If lifestyle changes are insufficient, a doctor may suggest remedies such as laxatives (including fiber supplements, osmotic agents, stool softeners, lubricants, and stimulant laxatives), suppositories, or enemas. In severe and long-lasting cases, biofeedback training or even surgery may be considered, but these require further discussion with a doctor."

      "detailed_description": "Cradle cap is a common and harmless skin condition affecting newborns and babies, characterized by rough patches on their scalp. It is considered the infant form of dandruff. While the exact cause is unknown, it is thought to result from the oil glands in the baby's skin producing excess oil, which causes dead skin cells to adhere to the scalp. A type of yeast called malassezia may also contribute to the condition. Although it may appear unsightly, cradle cap typically does not cause itching or significant discomfort to the baby.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of cradle cap is usually made through a visual examination of the baby's scalp and affected skin areas by a healthcare professional.",
      "how_to_care": "Cradle cap can often be managed with simple at-home care and usually resolves on its own over time. Key steps include keeping the baby's scalp clean by washing it gently with unscented baby shampoo, potentially more frequently than usual. After washing, gently brushing the baby's hair with a soft baby brush or comb can help loosen and remove scales. Rubbing petroleum jelly, baby oil, or plain mineral oil into the scales before shampooing may also be beneficial. It is important to avoid picking or scratching at the scales, as this can lead to raw skin and increase the risk of infection. While generally not necessary, a doctor may prescribe hydrocortisone cream if the scalp is inflamed, or an antifungal treatment like ketoconazole in some cases."

Symptoms typically appear 7 to 10 days after infection, though sometimes up to 28 days, and include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and occasionally vomiting. The parasite can be shed for weeks after symptoms resolve, posing an ongoing risk of transmission. Infections are commonly acquired while traveling abroad, and the parasite is highly tolerant to chlorine, allowing it to survive in chlorinated water.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Lab tests, typically involving stool samples, are used to identify the presence of the Cryptosporidium parasite.",
      "how_to_care": "Individuals with cryptosporidiosis should be excluded from settings (e.g., schools, childcare facilities) until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped and they are well enough to return. If there are two or more cases, public health authorities should be contacted. Encouraging good hand hygiene is crucial. Regular cleaning of kitchen and toilet areas, and using personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling blood or bodily fluids, are important preventive measures. Affected individuals should not go to swimming pools until 14 days after the last diarrheal episode due to the parasite's chlorine tolerance."

While normal skin cell shedding occurs, individuals with dandruff experience larger patches of skin flaking off at a faster rate. The condition can also affect areas around the eyebrows and the side of the nose. Common causes include irritated and oily skin, infrequent shampooing, the presence of a yeast-like fungus called malassezia (which feeds on scalp oils), dryness of the scalp, and contact dermatitis triggered by certain hair products. Dandruff is not caused by poor hygiene, though infrequent washing can make it more visible. It typically affects young adults to middle-aged individuals and is more prevalent in males.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of dandruff is usually made by a doctor or dermatologist through examination of the hair and scalp. Most cases do not require professional medical care.",
      "how_to_care": "The most common treatment for dandruff is the use of specialized dandruff shampoos. These shampoos contain active ingredients such as pyrithione zinc (antifungal and antibacterial), salicylic acid (promotes healing of scales), ketoconazole (kills fungi), tar-based ingredients (slows skin cell turnover), or selenium sulfide (antifungal). It is important to follow the shampoo instructions; for example, Caucasian and Asian individuals may need to shampoo twice per week, while African Americans may benefit from once per week. Trying different types of shampoos or alternating them may be necessary if one loses effectiveness. A doctor or dermatologist should be consulted if the condition does not clear up with over-the-counter products, if scalp irritation increases, or if there is severe swelling, redness, or scaling on the scalp or other body parts, as a prescription dandruff shampoo may be needed."

      "detailed_description": "Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside the body, most commonly in the legs. DVT can be particularly concerning because approximately half of affected individuals experience no symptoms at all, making it a 'silent' condition. However, if symptoms are present, they typically include swelling, pain, warmth, and redness in the affected limb. DVT is a significant public health concern, affecting between 300,000 to 600,000 people in the U.S. annually. A major complication of DVT is pulmonary embolism (PE), where a part of the blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs, blocking a blood vessel, which can be life-threatening.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "If Deep Vein Thrombosis is suspected, immediate medical consultation is recommended. Diagnostic tests commonly include a D-dimer blood test, which helps rule out the presence of a serious blood clot. A Doppler ultrasound is one of the primary and most effective methods for detecting DVT by visualizing blood flow in the veins. A venogram can also be used to detect issues in veins and show areas of clotting or clogging. In some cases, a CT scan may also be utilized.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for Deep Vein Thrombosis typically involves medication, primarily blood thinners (anticoagulants), and self-care measures. In some instances, surgical intervention may be necessary. Most individuals achieve a full recovery from DVT within a few weeks or months. The progression of treatment and recovery can vary based on the severity of the DVT and the individual's risk factors for recurrence. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary adjustments and regular exercise, are important components of managing DVT, as they aid circulation and can alleviate symptoms of venous insufficiency. Support from nonprofit organizations and online communities can also provide valuable information and emotional support for individuals living with DVT."

      "detailed_description": "Dehydration occurs when the body lacks sufficient fluid to function properly. It can range from mild, characterized by thirst and dry mouth, to severe, which is a medical emergency with symptoms like dizziness, fainting, and rapid heart rate. The severity in children is often assessed by the percentage of body weight lost due to fluid deficiency. Dehydration happens when the body's natural daily water loss (through sweating, breathing, urination, etc.) is not adequately replaced by drinking liquids and consuming water-rich foods. Factors such as fever, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating, and frequent urination (e.g., due to diabetes or diuretics) can increase fluid loss. Insufficient fluid intake can also result from being too busy, not recognizing thirst, or reluctance to drink due to conditions like a sore throat or upset stomach. Babies, young children, and older adults are at a higher risk due to various physiological and behavioral factors.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of dehydration is primarily based on the assessment of symptoms and a physical examination. Healthcare professionals evaluate the severity of fluid loss to determine the appropriate course of action.",
      "how_to_care": "For mild dehydration, treatment involves replacing lost fluids by consuming water, electrolyte drinks, or over-the-counter oral rehydration solutions. Moderate to severe dehydration requires immediate medical intervention, often involving intravenous (IV) fluid administration. Prevention is crucial and involves maintaining consistent hydration throughout the day: carrying a water bottle, drinking water before each meal, flavoring water with fruit slices, choosing water over sugary/alcoholic/caffeinated beverages, setting reminders to drink, and drinking as soon as thirst is felt. Incorporating water-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, and soups into the diet also contributes to hydration. During illness, pregnancy, or physical activity, when fluid loss is higher, maintaining hydration is particularly important."

It is a complex disease, and its exact causes are not fully understood, though it can arise from various factors including genetics, certain medications, and as a common complication of chronic illnesses. The manifestations of depression can vary widely in intensity and duration. Notably, depression can sometimes be disguised by physical symptoms, such as chronic pain, headaches, or stomachaches, making it challenging to identify without a comprehensive assessment. Severe depression may present with intense symptoms like significant appetite and weight loss, and severe sleep disturbances.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of depression often involves a combination of laboratory tests and detailed conversations with the patient about their symptoms and medical history. Treatment can be initiated by a primary care doctor, and the care team may include various mental health professionals such as a psychologist, social worker, therapist, psychiatrist, or psychiatric nurse practitioner.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment plans for depression are individualized based on the type and severity of the condition. They typically involve medication, such as antidepressants, which are prescription drugs designed to lift mood by affecting brain chemicals. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, is another effective tool, with approaches like psychodynamic therapy helping patients explore their emotions. For cases where treatment does not seem to be working, it may be identified as Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), which may require new high-tech treatments. Living with depression can be managed through various strategies, including simple lifestyle changes, establishing a daily routine, focusing on one's inner self to boost mood, and seeking support from family, friends, or support groups. It is crucial to seek help, as untreated depression can lead to complications and may worsen physical illnesses, with repeat episodes potentially damaging the brain over time."

      "disease_name": "Diabetes Type 1",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-making beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in little to no insulin production. Insulin is a vital hormone that facilitates the movement of glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into cells for energy. While historically known as juvenile diabetes due to its frequent diagnosis in children and young adults, approximately half of all new diagnoses now occur in adults. The development of Type 1 diabetes is believed to involve both a genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, such as infections or viruses, which may activate these genes.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes involves checking blood sugar levels through several methods. These include the A1c test, which measures average blood sugar over the past 3 months (a result of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes); a fasting blood sugar test (126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests); or a random blood sugar test (200 mg/dL or higher at any time). To differentiate Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes, doctors look for the presence of autoantibodies (immune system proteins that attack insulin-producing cells) in a blood sample, and ketones (acids produced when the body breaks down fat) in a urine test.",
      "how_to_care": "Living a long, healthy life with Type 1 diabetes requires careful management of blood sugar levels through daily insulin use. Insulin can be administered via injections (syringe and vial or prefilled pen), inhaled insulin, or an insulin pump. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems or regular finger-prick tests are crucial for monitoring glucose levels. Depending on the individual's health, doctors may also prescribe medications such as aspirin (to reduce heart event risk), cholesterol-lowering drugs, or high blood pressure medication (to improve kidney function). Lifestyle management is vital and includes maintaining a healthy diet (focusing on nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, and whole grains), getting sufficient sleep, managing stress, quitting smoking, and engaging in regular physical activity. Consistent medical, dental, and eye exams are essential to prevent or promptly treat potential complications."

      "detailed_description": "Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong condition where the body does not use insulin properly, a state known as insulin resistance. It is the most common form of diabetes, affecting approximately 1 in 10 people in the U.S., with nearly 1 in 3 having prediabetes. While traditionally affecting middle-aged or older individuals, Type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children and teens, primarily due to rising rates of childhood obesity. Symptoms can be mild and often go unnoticed, leading to many individuals being unaware of their condition. The disease is typically caused by a combination of genetic factors, excess weight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, and issues with insulin production and cell communication.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes usually involves blood tests performed on two different days. These include the A1c test, which provides an average percentage of blood glucose over the past 2-3 months (6.5% or higher indicates diabetes); a Fasting Plasma Glucose test, measuring blood sugar after an 8-hour fast (126 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes); and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), which checks blood glucose before and 2 hours after consuming a sweet drink (200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes).",
      "how_to_care": "Management of Type 2 diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. Lifestyle modifications are crucial and include weight loss (losing 5-7% of body weight can significantly improve blood sugar), healthy eating (fewer calories, reduced refined carbohydrates, increased vegetables, fruits, and fiber), and regular exercise (30-60 minutes daily). Blood sugar monitoring is often required, especially if on insulin. Medications may be prescribed if lifestyle changes are insufficient, including metformin (often first choice), sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and insulin. Weight loss surgery can also be an effective treatment. While Type 2 diabetes is not curable, remission (normal or prediabetes glucose levels) is possible, primarily through significant weight loss. Effective management is crucial to prevent serious complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, eye problems, and nerve damage."

The skin may feel tight, particularly after exposure to water from showering, bathing, or swimming. It can also manifest with unusual redness and visible lines or cracks, which may occasionally be deep enough to bleed. Various factors can cause dry skin, and its management often depends on the underlying trigger. These causes include aging (as oil glands produce less oil), atopic dermatitis (a type of eczema), prolonged exposure to hot water or chlorinated pools, smoking, harsh soaps, and dry, cold weather with low humidity.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of dry skin is typically made through visual examination of the skin and a review of the patient's history, including potential causes and aggravating factors. In cases where dry skin is a symptom of an underlying condition like atopic dermatitis, further evaluation may be necessary.",
      "how_to_care": "Effective care for dry skin focuses on moisturizing and avoiding irritants. Regular moisturizing with oils, lotions, or creams helps to smooth and soften the skin, reducing the likelihood of cracking and easing pain and itchiness. Products containing lactic acid, urea, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, squalane, or petrolatum are particularly effective at retaining moisture. For very dry skin, a dermatologist may prescribe stronger ointments or creams, such as corticosteroids or immune modulators. Preventive measures include applying moisturizer immediately after bathing, using a humidifier in dry environments, wearing natural fibers like cotton and silk that allow the skin to breathe, limiting long, hot showers, quitting smoking, and using gentle, oil-free soaps.

It is a very common condition, particularly in young children, with approximately half of all children experiencing at least one before their second birthday. In adults, ear infections are less common due to larger Eustachian tubes. These infections often follow an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or the flu, or can be triggered by allergies, which cause the Eustachian tube to swell and block airflow to the middle ear. While both bacteria and viruses can cause ear infections, bacterial infections typically follow a viral infection or an allergic reaction. Untreated ear infections can lead to complications such as temporary or permanent hearing loss, delayed speech development in young children, or, rarely, spread of infection to the brain.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of an ear infection typically involves a doctor observing a red and bulging eardrum during an examination. The healthcare provider will also assess the patient's symptoms and medical history. While not explicitly detailed, imaging tests like X-rays may be used in some cases. For children, specific signs like ear tugging, fussiness, and changes in sleep or appetite are key indicators. Adults may experience earache, muffled hearing, or discharge. It is important to seek medical attention if symptoms are severe, persistent, or accompanied by fever, fluid discharge, or facial weakness.",
      "how_to_care": "Approximately half of all ear infections resolve on their own without medication. For bacterial infections, a 10-day course of antibiotics, typically amoxicillin, is often prescribed, with improvement usually seen within a day. Pain relief can be achieved with over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. In some cases, fluid may remain in the middle ear, causing temporary hearing loss, which often clears with another course of antibiotics. Historically, ear tubes were used for recurrent infections, but current practice often defers this surgery. Preventing ear infections involves removing pollutants (dust, harsh chemicals, tobacco smoke) from the home, managing allergies, ensuring up-to-date vaccinations (flu, pneumococcal), practicing frequent hand-washing, breastfeeding infants (if possible), holding babies upright during bottle-feeding, and avoiding group daycare during the first year if feasible. It is crucial to complete the entire course of prescribed antibiotics to prevent antibiotic resistance."

      "detailed_description": "Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Occasional difficulty with erections is generally not a cause for concern. In older men, a common underlying cause of ED is decreased blood flow to the penis, often due to narrowed blood vessels. However, ED is a multifactorial condition; psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression are significant contributors, accounting for approximately 10-20% of cases. Various other medical conditions and lifestyle factors can also lead to ED.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosing Erectile Dysfunction involves a thorough evaluation by a doctor. Due to the many possible causes, various tests are employed to determine the underlying reason for ED and guide the best treatment approach. These tests may include physical examinations, blood tests (to check for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or hormonal imbalances), and sometimes specialized tests to assess blood flow to the penis. Open communication with the doctor about sexual matters, though potentially embarrassing, is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction is individualized and depends on the patient's overall health and the identified underlying cause. Options include medications designed to improve blood flow to the penis, and external devices such as vacuum constriction devices, which help achieve and maintain an erection. Beyond physical treatments, managing the emotional impact of ED is crucial for both the affected individual and their partner. Support and encouragement from a partner are important, and it is emphasized that sexual activity is not the sole means of maintaining intimacy in a relationship. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, adopting a healthy diet, and engaging in regular exercise, can also play a role in preventing or improving ED."

      "disease_name": "Fatty Liver Disease",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Fatty liver disease is a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver cells. A key feature of this disease is that the liver cells do not respond effectively to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. This insulin resistance leads the pancreas to produce more and more insulin. Fatty liver disease is closely linked to metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, and can cause inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which contribute to elevated blood pressure. The condition can also impact heart health, potentially leading to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), increased risk of heart attack, and alterations in heart shape and function, such as ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. In some cases, it can progress to cirrhosis, a severe form of liver disease, or even hepatopulmonary syndrome, where liver disease causes blood vessels in the lungs to widen, impairing oxygen transfer.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "The provided information does not explicitly detail diagnostic methods for fatty liver disease. However, in general medical practice, diagnosis typically involves a combination of physical examination, blood tests (e.g., liver function tests, blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides), and imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. A liver biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of liver damage.",
      "how_to_care": "While there is no specific cure for fatty liver disease, management primarily focuses on lifestyle changes to prevent progression and reduce associated risks. Key strategies include dietary modifications, such as following a low-calorie diet (1,200-1,600 calories per day), avoiding sugar, adhering to a low-fat diet (less than 10% saturated fats) rich in fruits and vegetables, and adopting a Mediterranean diet (high in healthy fats). Regular coffee consumption and intake of omega-3 fatty acids may also be beneficial. Engaging in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 135 minutes per week can help lower insulin resistance. Losing 5-10% of body weight can significantly improve fatty liver disease and may even reverse heart muscle damage. If diet and exercise are insufficient, weight loss surgery may be an option, though caution is advised for individuals with advanced heart problems. It is crucial to consult a doctor before making significant changes to diet or exercise routines."

      "detailed_description": "A food allergy occurs when the immune system defensively reacts to a specific food protein that is not inherently harmful. Upon initial exposure, the immune system produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Subsequent consumption of the allergen triggers these IgE antibodies to release large amounts of histamine, a potent chemical that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, or cardiovascular systems. Symptoms can appear almost immediately or up to two hours after consuming the food. Eight foods are responsible for over 90% of food allergies in children (cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts), while in adults, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are the primary culprits. Severe reactions, known as anaphylaxis, can be life-threatening.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of food allergies can involve several methods: a Radioallergosorbent blood test (RAST) to check antibody levels, an allergy skin test (scratch test) to identify triggers, and a food diary to track potential trigger foods. An elimination and challenge diet, where suspected foods are removed and then reintroduced, may also be used to observe reactions.",
      "how_to_care": "The primary treatment for a food allergy is strict avoidance of the foods that cause a reaction, while maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet. For mild reactions, antihistamines may help reduce itching and congestion, and often resolve without treatment. More serious reactions may be treated with corticosteroids to reduce swelling. In life-threatening situations (anaphylaxis), an epinephrine injection is the only effective treatment and can immediately reverse symptoms; individuals prescribed an auto-injector should carry two at all times. Preparedness for food allergies includes reading labels on processed foods for hidden allergens, being aware that some lotions/hair products/soaps/medications may contain food products, and communicating clearly with staff when dining out. In households with food allergies, marking food packages, preparing allergic person's food first, using separate utensils/cookware, thoroughly cleaning surfaces, and frequent hand washing are recommended. For children with allergies, an emergency plan with their school is crucial."

      "disease_name": "Food Poisoning",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Food poisoning is a general term for gastrointestinal infections caused by consuming contaminated food or drink. Symptoms typically begin within 1 to 2 days of ingesting contaminated food, and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Transmission can also occur from person-to-person if food is prepared by an infected individual who did not practice proper hand hygiene. This condition highlights the critical importance of food safety and hygiene practices in preventing illness.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of food poisoning is based on the patient's symptoms and a detailed history of recent food consumption. In some cases, laboratory tests, such as stool samples, may be conducted to identify the specific pathogen responsible for the illness.",
      "how_to_care": "Individuals with food poisoning should be excluded from settings (e.g., schools, workplaces, childcare facilities) until 48 hours after their diarrhea and vomiting symptoms have completely stopped and they are well enough to return. If two or more cases with similar symptoms are linked in time or place, or if there is a greater than expected rate of infection, public health authorities should be informed for investigation and guidance. Encouraging good hand hygiene, regular cleaning of kitchen and toilet areas, and using personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling blood or bodily fluids are essential preventive measures. For severe cases, specific treatments may be advised by public health authorities."

      "disease_name": "Gallstones",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Gallstones, or cholelithiasis, are solid masses that form in the gallbladder, a small organ beneath the liver that stores bile. They are primarily composed of cholesterol (80% of cases) or bilirubin (pigment stones). Many individuals with gallstones remain asymptomatic, a condition referred to as 'silent gallstones,' which typically do not require treatment. However, symptoms arise when gallstones obstruct the flow of bile, leading to a 'gallbladder attack' or biliary colic, characterized by intense pain. Gallstones are more common in women, individuals over 40, those of Native American or Mexican descent, and people who are obese, have a low-fiber diet, lack exercise, use estrogen, have diabetes, or experience rapid weight loss.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of gallstones involves a physical exam and various tests. Blood tests can check for infection or blockage. Imaging tests include abdominal ultrasound (to show gallstones and inflammation), CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) to assess gallbladder function. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound may be used to detect stones in bile ducts. It is crucial to seek immediate medical care for severe or prolonged abdominal pain, fever with chills, or jaundice, as these may indicate complications.",
      "how_to_care": "Asymptomatic gallstones generally do not require treatment, as small stones can sometimes pass naturally. For symptomatic gallstones that block bile ducts, surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the most common treatment, performed either laparoscopically or through open surgery. The body can function normally without a gallbladder. Non-surgical options for patients unable to undergo surgery include ERCP to remove stuck stones, medications (e.g., chenodiol, ursodiol) to dissolve small cholesterol stones (may take years and stones can recur), and rarely, shock wave lithotripsy to break up stones. Prevention involves a nutritious diet rich in fiber and unsaturated fats, limiting processed foods, sugar, saturated and trans fats, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding rapid weight loss diets, and discussing hormonal birth control with a doctor if at high risk."

      "disease_name": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a chronic digestive disorder where the stomach's contents, including acid, repeatedly flow back into the esophagus. This backwash can irritate the esophageal lining. While heartburn is a common symptom, not all individuals with GERD experience it. The condition can lead to discomfort and, if uncontrolled, may cause complications and damage to the esophagus, potentially increasing the risk of esophageal cancer.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of GERD commonly involves three main tests: esophageal pH monitoring, which measures acid levels in the esophagus over 24 hours; endoscopy, where a flexible tube with a camera is used to examine the throat, esophagus, and stomach; and manometry, an outpatient test that assesses movement and pressure in the esophagus. An upper endoscopy can specifically help determine the cause of heartburn and is often performed as an outpatient procedure.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for GERD aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. While specific treatments are not detailed, generally, care involves lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes (avoiding trigger foods), weight management, and elevating the head during sleep. Medications like antacids for occasional heartburn, and more potent prescription drugs (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers) for persistent symptoms, are often used. If left uncontrolled, GERD can lead to serious complications, emphasizing the importance of consistent management."

      "disease_name": "Gestational Diabetes",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Gestational diabetes is a condition that causes high blood sugar levels during pregnancy, which can impact both the pregnancy itself and the baby's health. Most of the time, gestational diabetes does not present with easily noticeable symptoms, though increased thirst and more frequent urination are possible indicators. The exact reason why some individuals develop it is unknown, but factors like extra weight before pregnancy and hormonal changes during pregnancy are believed to play a role. These hormonal shifts can make it harder for the body to utilize blood sugar effectively, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. The condition can increase the risk of various complications for the baby, including high birth weight, early birth (preterm birth), respiratory distress syndrome, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after birth, and a higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. For the pregnant individual, risks include high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and a higher likelihood of needing a C-section delivery. It also increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes in future pregnancies and type 2 diabetes later in life.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is typically done through screening tests during pregnancy, as it often doesn't cause obvious symptoms. While not explicitly detailed, these screenings usually involve glucose tolerance tests. It is advisable to seek healthcare when planning to conceive.",
      "how_to_care": "Gestational diabetes can often be controlled through lifestyle interventions and, if necessary, medication. Key management strategies include eating healthy foods, focusing on a variety of high-fiber, low-fat, and low-calorie options, with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and practicing healthy portion sizes. Regular physical activity before and during pregnancy can help prevent gestational diabetes; aiming for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week, such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming, is recommended. Starting pregnancy at a healthy weight and avoiding excessive or rapid weight gain during pregnancy are also crucial preventive measures. If lifestyle changes are insufficient, medication may be prescribed to manage blood sugar levels."

      "disease_name": "Gingivitis",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gingiva, which is the part of the gum around the base of the teeth. It causes irritation, redness, swelling, and bleeding of the gums, particularly when brushing or flossing. Healthy gums are typically firm and pale pink, fitting tightly around the teeth. The most common cause of gingivitis is inadequate oral hygiene, specifically not keeping teeth and gums clean. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to more serious conditions like periodontitis, which involves bone loss and can lead to tooth loss.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of gingivitis is usually made by a dentist through a visual examination of the gums and teeth. The dentist will look for swollen, discolored, or bleeding gums. If any symptoms of gingivitis are noticed, scheduling an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible is recommended. The sooner care is sought, the better the chances of reversing damage and preventing progression to periodontitis. If symptoms do not improve, the dentist may refer the patient to a periodontist, a gum specialist. Dental X-rays can also help pinpoint diseases not visible during a visual exam and monitor changes in dental health.",
      "how_to_care": "Prevention and reversal of gingivitis primarily involve practicing good oral hygiene. This means brushing teeth for two minutes at least twice daily (morning and before bed), and flossing at least once a day (ideally before brushing to remove loosened food particles and bacteria). Regular dental checkups and professional cleanings, usually every 6 to 12 months, are crucial for removing plaque and tartar that cannot be removed by brushing alone. For individuals with risk factors like dry mouth, certain medications, or smoking, more frequent professional cleanings may be needed. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including healthy eating habits and managing blood sugar levels if diabetic, is important for supporting gum health."

      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Glandular fever, also known as infectious mononucleosis or 'mono,' is a viral infection primarily affecting young adults, though children can also contract it. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms typically include profound fatigue, aching muscles, a sore throat, fever, and swollen glands in the neck; occasionally, jaundice may occur. In children, the illness is generally milder. The incubation period is approximately 4 to 6 weeks. While symptoms usually subside within 2 to 3 weeks, fatigue can persist for a longer duration. The virus is found in the saliva of infected individuals and is spread through direct contact with saliva (e.g., kissing, coughing, sneezing, sharing utensils) or indirectly via contaminated objects if hands are not adequately washed.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of glandular fever is typically based on the characteristic symptoms and a physical examination. Blood tests can confirm the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus.",
      "how_to_care": "There is no specific treatment for glandular fever, as it is a viral infection that usually resolves on its own. Care focuses on symptom management and preventing spread. Individuals are encouraged to practice good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene (e.g., covering coughs and sneezes). Rest and plenty of fluids are important for recovery. Since the virus is spread through saliva, avoiding sharing utensils and close contact can help limit transmission."

      "disease_name": "Glaucoma",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Glaucoma is an eye disease that can progressively worsen over time and is a leading cause of severe, permanent vision loss and eventual total blindness. It typically affects individuals aged 40 and older, with experts estimating that 10% of people over 75 have glaucoma. The condition occurs when the resistance in the eye's drainage canals increases, causing fluid to build up and put pressure on the eye. This elevated intraocular pressure can damage the optic nerve and retina. While most types of glaucoma affect individuals over 40, congenital types are an exception. Race and sex can also influence risk, with Black people having a higher risk of primary open-angle glaucoma and women having a higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes are linked to higher odds of developing glaucoma.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of glaucoma typically involves a comprehensive eye examination. No specific tests or procedures are used for diagnosing ocular rosacea, but a doctor will likely make a diagnosis based on symptoms, medical history, and an examination of the eyes, eyelids, and facial skin. If symptoms involve the eyes, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may perform further tests. For glaucoma, tests focus on measuring intraocular pressure and assessing optic nerve health. Angle-closure glaucoma, which develops quickly, requires immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage and vision loss, looking for sudden onset or worsening of severe eye pain/pressure, headaches, double/blurred vision, nausea/vomiting with eye pain, rainbow halos around lights, or sudden vision loss.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for glaucoma primarily focuses on lowering the pressure inside the eye to prevent further damage to the optic nerve and retina, as vision loss due to glaucoma is irreversible. Medications, mainly eye drops, are used to reduce intraocular pressure and can prevent glaucoma from developing or worsening. Surgical options aim to improve the drainage of aqueous humor fluid to lower eye pressure; these include trabeculectomy, tube shunts, laser therapy, and minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS). With consistent treatment, it is possible to slow or entirely stop the progression of the disease. Lifestyle recommendations include maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active (with caution regarding activities that may increase eye pressure), and regular follow-up with an eye care provider. Avoiding new symptoms or vision changes is crucial, and limiting caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco can help prevent symptom worsening by restricting blood flow."

Men are generally more likely to experience symptoms than women, although the infection can also affect the anal passage, throat, and eyes. Gonorrhoea is passed on during unprotected sexual contact.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of gonorrhoea is based on symptoms. Individuals experiencing STI symptoms should visit a GUM (Genitourinary Medicine) or local sexual health clinic for free, confidential advice and screening. Laboratory tests, such as swabs from affected areas or urine tests, are used to confirm the bacterial infection.",
      "how_to_care": "Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics. Individuals diagnosed with gonorrhoea should advise their sexual contacts to get screened and should avoid sexual activity until treatment is completed and results are known. To lower the risk of infection, sexually active individuals are advised to reduce their number of partners, decrease the frequency of partner change, and consistently and correctly use condoms. Maintaining strict confidentiality regarding the diagnosis is important."

      "disease_name": "Gout",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Gout is a form of arthritis characterized by sudden, excruciatingly painful attacks in a joint, most frequently the big toe, but it can affect other joints like knees, ankles, elbows, thumbs, or fingers. These attacks are unexpected but usually resolve pain and inflammation within a few days with prompt treatment, though they can recur. Over 8 million Americans are affected by gout. It is more common in men, typically developing between ages 30 and 50, while women are more prone to it after menopause. Gout is the body's reaction to irritating crystal deposits of uric acid in the joints, which occurs due to an excess of uric acid in the blood. This excess can be from the body's natural production or diet, or inefficient kidney excretion. Chronic gout can lead to the formation of hard lumps called tophi and kidney stones.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of gout is based on symptoms, physical examination, and blood tests to measure uric acid levels. A doctor can perform blood and urine tests to assess the risk of a gout attack. In some cases, fluid may be drawn from the affected joint for microscopic examination to identify uric acid crystals.",
      "how_to_care": "Prompt treatment usually resolves pain and inflammation within a few days. Mild cases may be managed with diet alone. Recurrent attacks may necessitate long-term medication to prevent joint damage and kidney issues. Medications include allopurinol, colchicine, pegloticase, probenecid, and rasburicase, which decrease uric acid production or increase its excretion. Febuxostat may be used if other medications are ineffective, with caution for heart issues. To prevent gout, especially with a family history, men should limit alcohol (particularly beer), fats, and purine-rich foods (meat, seafood, yeast). Drinking plenty of liquids can help prevent kidney stones. Men at higher risk should also monitor their weight. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for pain and inflammation during attacks."

      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Strep A, is a common type of bacteria that can cause a range of infections, from mild to severe. Mild infections include scarlet fever, impetigo, and strep throat, which are typically easily treated with antibiotics. However, GAS can also cause more serious, invasive infections (iGAS) if the bacteria enter parts of the body where they are not normally found, such as the lungs or bloodstream, which can be fatal in rare cases.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of GAS infections is typically made through clinical assessment of symptoms, and confirmed by laboratory tests such as a rapid strep test or throat culture for strep throat. For invasive GAS infections, diagnosis involves identifying the bacteria in normally sterile body sites (e.g., blood cultures).",
      "how_to_care": "Mild GAS infections can usually be managed at home with antibiotics. Individuals with a mild GAS infection should stay away from group settings (e.g., school, childcare) for 24 hours after starting antibiotics to prevent spread. Most Strep A infections respond well to antibiotics. For serious invasive GAS infections, hospital treatment is often necessary. If a case of invasive GAS occurs in a setting, public health authorities should be informed to conduct a risk assessment and organize preventative antibiotics for close contacts if needed. Encouraging good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene practices is crucial for preventing the spread of GAS."

      "disease_name": "Hair Loss",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Hair loss is a common occurrence, with individuals typically losing up to 100 strands daily as part of a natural cycle. However, many people eventually experience a point where hair loss exceeds regrowth. The most frequent cause in men (up to 95% of cases) is male pattern baldness, a genetic condition where hair follicles become sensitive to DHT, leading to progressive thinning and eventual cessation of growth. In women, hair loss often presents as general thinning over the scalp, particularly at the crown. Other causes include hormonal imbalances, stress, illness, childbirth, fungal infections, certain medications (e.g., chemotherapy, blood thinners), physical injuries (burns, X-rays), autoimmune diseases (alopecia areata), and various medical conditions (thyroid disease, lupus, diabetes, anemia). Cosmetic procedures and dietary deficiencies can also contribute.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of hair loss typically involves a dermatologist who will discuss symptoms, examine affected areas, and gently pull on hairs to check for easy removal. The dermatologist may also inspect individual hairs and nails for abnormalities. Rarely, a skin biopsy may be performed. To rule out other causes, tests for fungal infections or blood tests (for thyroid, hormone, or immune system issues) may be ordered. For male pattern baldness, the Norwood scale categorizes severity into seven stages.",
      "how_to_care": "Not all types of hair loss are preventable, especially if genetic or due to necessary medical treatments. However, various remedies and treatments can encourage new hair growth or strengthen existing hair. These include biotin supplements, regular scalp massages (potentially with essential oils like lavender or rosemary), and quitting smoking. Medical treatments may involve over-the-counter products (e.g., minoxidil), prescription medications (e.g., finasteride, antiandrogens, corticosteroids), hair transplant surgery, light cap therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, and radiofrequency microneedling. Proper hair care practices, such as avoiding damaging chemicals, gentle styling, limiting heat exposure, and proper washing, are crucial. Stress management and a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients are also important. For sudden or significant hair loss, consulting a doctor is advised to rule out underlying conditions."

      "disease_name": "Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, is a common allergic response that causes cold-like symptoms. Unlike a common cold, it is not caused by a virus but by an immune system reaction to a harmless airborne substance (allergen) that the body mistakenly identifies as harmful. The body produces IgE antibodies, which signal the immune system to release chemicals like histamine, leading to symptoms. Hay fever can significantly interfere with daily life, work, and school, and can disrupt sleep. Common allergens include tree pollen (early spring), grass pollen (late spring/summer), ragweed pollen (fall), and year-round allergens like dust mites, cockroach droppings, pet dander, and spores from indoor/outdoor fungi and molds. Having other allergies, asthma, or a family history of allergies/asthma increases the risk.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of hay fever is based on symptoms and medical history. If symptoms are severe or persistent, or if allergy medicines are ineffective, a healthcare professional may recommend skin tests or blood tests to identify the exact allergens triggering symptoms. This testing helps determine specific avoidance strategies and the most effective treatments.",
      "how_to_care": "The primary approach to managing hay fever is to lessen exposure to the specific allergens that cause symptoms. This includes staying indoors on dry, windy days, avoiding gardening chores that stir up allergens, removing clothes worn outside and showering to rinse off pollen, and not hanging laundry outdoors. Using air conditioning in homes and cars, and high-efficiency filters in heating/AC systems can help. Medications include oral antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine), corticosteroid nasal sprays (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide, triamcinolone), cromolyn sodium nasal spray, and oral decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine). Rinsing nasal passages with saline solution (nasal irrigation) is an effective way to flush out mucus and allergens. For some individuals, allergy shots (allergen immunotherapy) or sublingual tablets can reduce the immune system's reaction over time. It is recommended to start allergy medications before symptoms begin if high pollen counts are forecasted."

They are highly contagious but cannot jump, fly, or swim; they spread primarily through direct head-to-head contact. The eggs, known as nits, are grey or brown and stick firmly to hair near the scalp, hatching in 7 to 10 days. Empty eggshells are white and shiny. Itching and scratching typically begin 2 to 3 weeks after contact with lice.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis involves visually identifying live lice or nits (eggs) on the hair and scalp. Regular head checks are crucial for early identification.",
      "how_to_care": "Exclusion from school or childcare is generally not required for head lice. Care focuses on treatment and prevention of spread. Parents and caregivers should perform regular head checks and provide good hair care to identify and treat head lice early. Treatment typically involves over-the-counter or prescription medicated shampoos or lotions designed to kill lice and nits. It is also important to comb out nits with a fine-toothed comb. Avoiding sharing personal items like combs, brushes, hats, and scarves can help prevent transmission. Public health notifications to parents may not reduce transmission and can cause anxiety, so careful consideration is advised."

Most heart attacks, a severe manifestation of heart disease, result from coronary heart disease, where coronary arteries become clogged with fatty, calcified plaques. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women over 40, especially after menopause, and is a significant health concern for men as well. Conditions such as an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly), irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and heart valve disease are common forms of heart disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, stress, smoking, and insufficient exercise.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of heart disease involves a comprehensive approach. Warning signs often prompt medical attention, and a physical exam is typically performed. Diagnostic tests include an Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart), Chest X-ray, Stress Test (evaluates heart response to exertion), and Tilt Table Test (identifies cause of fainting spells). Further tests may include EKG (Electrocardiogram), blood tests (e.g., for troponins), cardiac catheterization, and coronary angiography to visualize blood vessels and blockages.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for heart disease varies depending on the specific condition and its severity. Medications such as stents (to keep arteries open), heart bypass surgery, and valve disease treatments (including traditional surgery and balloon valvuloplasty) are common interventions. Pacemakers are used to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm for individuals with irregular heartbeats. Living with heart disease involves crucial lifestyle changes, including adopting a heart-healthy cooking style (focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, low-fat dairy, and limiting salt/fat/sugar), and engaging in safe exercises tailored for heart conditions. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation programs are often encouraged to support full recovery. Regular doctor visits, stress management, and quitting smoking are also vital for long-term heart health."

Internal hemorrhoids may bleed but are usually not painful, while external hemorrhoids can be itchy and painful, and may occasionally bleed. Prolapsed hemorrhoids are internal hemorrhoids that bulge outside the anus, potentially causing pain and bleeding. Thrombosed hemorrhoids occur when a blood clot forms in an external hemorrhoid, leading to a painful, purple/blue lump. Hemorrhoids are often caused or worsened by activities that increase pressure, such as straining during bowel movements, heavy lifting, prolonged sitting on the toilet, chronic constipation or diarrhea, a low-fiber diet, pregnancy, overweight/obesity, and anal intercourse.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of hemorrhoids is typically made through a physical examination, including an inspection of the anus and rectum. The healthcare provider will assess for swollen veins, lumps, or other abnormalities. For internal hemorrhoids, a digital rectal exam may be performed. Most symptoms improve with at-home treatments, but a healthcare provider should be consulted if symptoms persist beyond a week, or if severe symptoms such as abdominal pain, chronic constipation or diarrhea, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or severe rectal bleeding and pain occur.",
      "how_to_care": "Symptoms of hemorrhoids often improve within a week with at-home treatments. These include applying over-the-counter medications containing lidocaine, witch hazel, or hydrocortisone to the affected area. Drinking more water, increasing dietary fiber intake (25-38 grams/day) or taking fiber supplements, soaking in warm baths (sitz baths) for 10-20 minutes daily, taking laxatives to soften stool, and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation can provide relief. For persistent or severe cases, a healthcare provider may perform rubber band ligation (to cut off blood supply to the hemorrhoid) or electrocoagulation (using electric current to stop blood flow). To prevent hemorrhoids, it is important to avoid straining during bowel movements, go to the toilet when the urge arises, drink plenty of water, consume a high-fiber diet, stay physically active, and use laxatives or enemas only as recommended by a healthcare provider."

      "how_to_care": "Individuals with chronic Hepatitis B infection generally do not require exclusion from settings or restriction of activities. People with acute Hepatitis B will typically be too ill to attend public settings and should follow their doctor's advice for return. Maintaining good hygiene practices is crucial, including regular cleaning of kitchen and toilet areas. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn when handling or cleaning blood, urine, loose stools, and vomit. A standard approach to cleaning all spillages of blood and bodily fluids as potentially infectious should be followed. It is important to complete accident reports for any exposures. Educating young people on safe sex practices is also a key preventive measure, as HBV can be sexually transmitted."

      "disease_name": "Hepatitis C",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that affects the liver. Symptoms can be vague, including loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain; jaundice is less common compared to hepatitis B. A significant proportion of infected individuals, up to 80%, may become asymptomatic carriers. The virus is present in the blood and other bodily fluids of infected persons and is spread through similar routes as hepatitis B, primarily via contact with infected blood. It cannot be spread through casual contact.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of Hepatitis C involves blood tests to detect the virus or antibodies. A healthcare professional will assess symptoms and medical history. Public health authorities should be contacted for advice if needed.",
      "how_to_care": "Individuals with chronic Hepatitis C generally do not require exclusion from settings or restriction of activities. Maintaining good hygiene practices is crucial, including regular cleaning of kitchen and toilet areas. A standard approach to cleaning all spillages of blood and bodily fluids as potentially infectious should be followed. It is important to ensure personal hygiene items (toothbrushes, nail cutters, razors, nail scissors) are not shared and that appropriate sanitary item disposal containers are available. Educating young people on safe sex practices is also a key preventive measure, as HCV can be transmitted sexually, though less commonly than HBV."

      "disease_name": "Hernia",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "A hernia is the bulging of abdominal contents through a weak spot or hole in the muscles of the abdominal wall, usually at the front. The bulging typically involves a loop of the intestine or the omentum (fatty tissue). Ventral hernias are a common type, and while their symptoms can be mild and persist for years, complications such as incarceration (contents trapped) or strangulation (blood supply blocked) can lead to dangerous and life-threatening situations. Some hernias in children, like umbilical hernias, may close on their own by age 3, but most ventral hernias worsen over time and require treatment. Epigastric hernias are located above the belly button, and paraumbilical hernias are beside it, often occurring in overweight women.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of a hernia typically involves a physical examination by a doctor. The doctor will inquire about any pain and whether the lump can be pushed back (reducible hernia). The doctor may ask the patient to stand and cough, as this action can make the bulge more apparent. If a tumor or other growth is suspected, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be requested to confirm the diagnosis.",
      "how_to_care": "Most ventral hernias require surgery for complete treatment, as they do not resolve on their own and cannot be treated with medicine. The aim of surgery is to push the bulged intestines or fatty tissue back into the abdomen and strengthen the abdominal wall. Hernia repair can be performed by open surgery or laparoscopy (minimally invasive). While most hernia surgeries are planned procedures, emergency surgery is necessary if the hernia becomes obstructed (part of the intestines is trapped and blocked, causing severe pain, vomiting, and abdominal swelling, and inability to pass gas or motions) or strangulated (blood supply to trapped organs is cut off, leading to tissue death). After surgery, pain relievers are prescribed, and common, usually temporary, side effects may include constipation, difficulty passing urine, shoulder pain, bruising, and testicular swelling. Recovery typically takes a few weeks."

      "disease_name": "High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the blood vessel walls is consistently too high. This sustained elevation can lead to various health complications over time. It is a prevalent condition, affecting approximately 1 in 2 adult Americans, with many more at risk. Hypertension is often referred to as 'the silent killer' because it typically presents without noticeable symptoms for years, leading to many individuals being unaware they have it. Despite its silent nature, high blood pressure is preventable, treatable, and its onset can be delayed. There are two main types: primary (essential) hypertension, which has no clear identifiable cause and develops over years, and secondary hypertension, which has a direct, identifiable cause and is usually more sudden and severe.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "The only definitive way to diagnose hypertension is by measuring blood pressure with a cuff. During diagnosis, a doctor will also consider the patient's medical and family history and assess other risk factors. For a sudden and significant rise in blood pressure (180/120 mmHg or higher) accompanied by severe symptoms, it is considered a hypertensive crisis and requires immediate medical attention. Regular checkups and home monitoring are crucial for early detection, as symptoms often do not appear until the condition is severe.",
      "how_to_care": "Treatment for high blood pressure involves a combination of lifestyle changes and, if necessary, drug therapy. Lifestyle modifications are crucial for both prevention and treatment, and can enhance the effectiveness of medications. These include weight loss (even 5 pounds can help), quitting smoking, following the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan (rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and potassium, low in sodium, sugary drinks, high-fat meats/dairy), reducing sodium intake (aim for <1,500 mg/day if hypertensive), engaging in regular aerobic exercise (at least 30 minutes/day, several times/week), limiting alcohol consumption (men: 2 drinks/day max; women: 1 drink/day max), and reducing stress. Medications include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics (often first-line), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, alpha-agonists, and renin inhibitors. Consistent follow-up care, including regular doctor visits and periodic blood tests, is critical for managing hypertension effectively and monitoring for organ damage."

      "disease_name": "High Cholesterol",
      "symptoms":,
      "detailed_description": "High cholesterol refers to unhealthy levels of lipids in the blood, which includes 'bad' (LDL) cholesterol, 'good' (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. A high level of cholesterol in the blood typically does not present with obvious symptoms, making it a 'silent' risk factor. However, it significantly increases the risk for serious conditions that do have symptoms, including angina (chest pain), high blood pressure, stroke, and other circulatory ailments. Unhealthy cholesterol levels are strongly linked to the hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Individuals can be slim and feel healthy yet still have a cholesterol problem. Soft, yellowish growths on the skin called xanthomas may suggest elevated cholesterol levels.",
      "how_to_diagnose": "Diagnosis of high cholesterol is made through a simple blood test, typically a lipid profile, which measures the levels of various fats in the blood. For individuals aged 20 or older, it is recommended to get cholesterol levels checked every 4 to 6 years. More frequent testing is advised for those who are overweight, diabetic, or have existing heart disease. The absence of obvious symptoms underscores the importance of regular screening for early detection.",
      "how_to_care": "Once a cholesterol problem is identified, management involves a combination of diet, lifestyle changes, and, if necessary, medication. Regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to control cholesterol; even 30 minutes of brisk walking, swimming, or dancing three to four times a week can be beneficial, and resistance training may also help. Quitting smoking is crucial, as it lowers 'good' HDL cholesterol and is linked to high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important, as excess weight, particularly visceral fat around the belly, can raise 'bad' LDL cholesterol and lower 'good' HDL. Limiting saturated fats (from red meat, full-fat dairy, tropical oils) and completely avoiding trans fats can significantly improve cholesterol numbers. Treating underlying conditions such as diabetes or obesity is also vital, as improving these conditions can positively impact cholesterol levels. If lifestyle changes are insufficient, a doctor may prescribe medications like statins. It is essential not to skip doses or alter the treatment plan without consulting a doctor."
